# Git Gud

A workshop for `git` beginners, hosted by UW Bothell ACM.

## Workshop Materials

The workshop slides are available under the `/slides` folder.

## External Resources

There are a ton of excellent materials available online about `git`. 
Here, we present a curated collection of meaningful, well-written, and 
endlessly useful resources.

### Getting Started

* Atlassian (the company behind BitBucket) has an excellent and easy-to-digest 
  series of tutorials about `git`. Start with their guide on 
  [basic end-to-end usage](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository).
* The [Commands Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) 
  is a perfect pocket guide to CLI commands for `git`.

### Comprehending Branching

* [Think Like (a) Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/) dives into 
  the structure of repositories and how branches tie together a repository's 
  state and history. It is also hilarious.

### Creating Quality Commits

Commit etiquette is another convention which illuminates the purpose of a project 
and makes collaboration easier.

* [Chris Beams' iconic post about commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) 
  is a masterpiece.
* [`git add --patch`](https://johnkary.net/blog/git-add-p-the-most-powerful-git-feature-youre-not-using-yet/)
  enables concise, topical commits which focus on a single feature.

### Understanding Git Workflows

* Read Atlassian's [workflow guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) 
  to learn more about how branching, merging, rebasing, and code reviews 
  tie in to _collaboration_.
* Read this [goofy & opinionated piece](https://tomayko.com/blog/2008/the-thing-about-git) 
  about how `git` is friendly to the workflow of _individual developers_.
